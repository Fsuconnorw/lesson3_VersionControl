            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Version control is what developers use to organize and record files over the course of the development process.  It is crucial to keep previous versions of your application in order to restore it back in order in case the newer developments go awry.  For the lone developer, a system called RCS was created to store the changes between versions locally on a single computer.  For multiple developers, the creation of Centralized Version Control Systems and Distributed Version Control Systems that were separate from the computers used to edit the applications.  The most important distinction between the two is that Distributed Version Control Systems face a much lower risk of data loss due to its ability to backup data on every system in the network.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While Git provides the same function as a Version Control System, the way it provides its service is completely different.  Git sees data as a "stream of snapshots," where each time the "commit" command is used, it takes a picture of exactly how the files look at that moment in time.  Git is also much faster than other control systems by cutting out most of the need to fetch data from a server, as it is retrieves information from local files instead.  The reliance on local files also makes it very handy, as the need for a network connection or internet access to store changes is no longer an issue if the developer is disconnected.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git repositories can be created by two different methods, initializing a repository or by cloning an existing repository.  To initalize a repository, the command "git add" is used to queue up files from the directory, followed by the command "git commit" to commence the tracking and storing of files.  If a developer wants to jump into a pre-existing repository, he or she will use the "git clone" command followed by a url specific for the repository. A copy of the files from the repository will be sent to the new system, allowing the developer to jump into the fray easily.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Making Changes to a Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">After a repository is set up, it is imperative to know how to backup and save your data as the development process continues on.  The "git status" command is extremely useful for tracking the progress that has been made since the last "commit" command.  It shows a list of files that have been modified or are untracked, which makes it easy to see the files that need to be added to the next commit.  In the case of a file that a developer wants git to ignore, the command ".gitignore" will allow the developer to set up a list of rules to ignore files that fall under those rules. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local and Remote Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What makes git so incredibly useful is that it allows developers to utilize local and remote repositories to their respective strengths.  Adding and committing the updated files allows the local repository to recall files with speed and ease, allowing the developer to utilize the benefits of having the repository on his or her system.  The "git push" command forwards the files to a remote repository far away from the developer to ensure that data backups will not be lost.  Git's ability to provide speed and ease of access, while maintaining data security is what makes the project so important for up-and-coming developers to learn how to use.</p>
